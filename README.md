Stacks, queues, LIFO, and FIFO are data structures used in computer science to store and organize data. 

1. Stack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. The operations performed on a stack are push (adding an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removing an element from the top of the stack).

2. Queue: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. The operations performed on a queue are enqueue (adding an element to the back of the queue) and dequeue (removing an element from the front of the queue).

3. LIFO: LIFO stands for Last In First Out, which means that the last item added to a collection will be the first one removed. This concept is commonly used in stacks.

4. FIFO: FIFO stands for First In First Out, which means that the first item added to a collection will be the first one removed. This concept is commonly used in queues.
